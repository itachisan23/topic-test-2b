# Topic Test B - Prereqs

The classes in this project will be necessary for your Topic Test B.
You will need to complete the following before the Practice and Real tests:

1. implement the `remove` method in the `LinkedList` class. (DO THIS FIRST)
2. implement the `ListBackedQueue` class. It's like 5 lines of code.
 
Do NOT worry about implementing the `indexOf` method.

It is up to **you** to test your own work. Or not. Choose wisely!
